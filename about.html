          <div class="about-text">
            <p>At The Education Institute for Early Intervention (EIEI), we address a critical issue in childcare—suspensions and expulsions of young children, often due to behavioral challenges linked to inadequate support for children with Individual Family Service Plans (IFSPs) or Individual Education Plans (IEPs). EIEI educates and empowers childcare professionals to create inclusive environments that foster children’s development and well-being. We collaborate with families, educators, and community partners to drive meaningful change, ensuring all children receive the support they need to thrive.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Why EIEI?</h2>
        <h3>Why Are Expulsions and Suspensions Happening in Childcare Programs?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Young children ages one to five are suspended, expelled, and never return to programs because of their behaviors.</li>
          <li>Many Full/Part-time childcare professionals lack training and experience to support and accommodate children with IFSPs and IEPs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Children who are expelled from Childcare are more likely to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Miss opportunities to grow, develop and practice social and emotional skills</li>
          <li>Continue to develop behavior problems that lead to difficulties adjusting to kindergarten and potentially suspensions in grade school.</li>
          <li>Experience harmful effects on development, relationships, education, and health.</li>
          <li>Develop negative views towards school, teachers, and the world around them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Families who have a child with an IFSP or IEP:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Become frustrated with childcare programs where employees are not adequately trained or lack experience in Special Education Services that provide support and development for their child.</li>
          <li>Experience difficulty with parenting, which could potentially lead to detachment and family risk factors.</li>
          <li>They may disassociate themselves from family, friends, and social activities due to their child’s disability and lack of social skills among peers.</li>
          <li>May experience increased stress and financial challenges</li>
          <li>They are more likely to seek alternative care, which may lead to a lack of full-time employment or professional careers due to instability in childcare.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Childcare Perspective</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Childcare staff is required to manage children that exhibit challenging behaviors but often lack the education, experience, and skills needed to respond appropriately to the child.</li>
          <li>Staff is often paid low salaries, experience poor working conditions, and have high teacher/child ratios that affect classroom management and the ability to manage behaviors effectively.</li>
          <li>Moreover, childcare staff may have “Implicit Bias” that leads to stress, burn-out, and low retention rates in the childcare workforce.</li>
        </ul>
